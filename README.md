## Overview
This is a **simple console-based Inventory Management System** in Python that allows you to:

- Add inventory items  
- Search inventory by `Item_ID`, `Item_Name`, `Category`, or `Supplier_Name`  
- Delete inventory items  
- Update inventory items  
- View all inventory IDs, names, or full inventory records  

The program maintains an **inventory text file (`inventory.txt`)** and creates **backups** before deletion or update.

---

## Features
1. **ID Generator:** Automatically generates unique `Item_ID`.  
2. **Validation:** Input checks for proper data types.  
3. **Backup:** Automatic backup created before deletion or update.  
4. **Search:** Search inventory by multiple fields.  
5. **View Options:** View only IDs, names, or all inventory details.
